## Coral Reefs: Impact of Salinity and Temperature 

Maggie Li 
OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

This project investigates the relationship between salinity, temperature, and coral reef distribution. Using global datasets from NOAA and SimonCMAP, the analysis identifies salinity and temperature ranges that favor coral reef presence. Visualizations and statistical analyses reveal strong environmental constraints on reef growth, with exceptions suggesting potential resilience or adaptation in some coral species.
